**Architecture**

Utilize a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.\
Implement a responsive frontend and a robust backend.
\
\
Main sources for extracting trip details and travel updates:\
\
**Travel-Related User Emails**: Users have the option to forward their travel-related emails to the Road Warriors mailbox. In this way, the system processes the travel-related emails from individual users, ensuring that their privacy and data security are maintained, as they do not need to grant read access to external entities.\
\
**Manual User Entries:** Alternatively, users can manually input the details of their reservations directly into the dashboard. This option allows users to have full control over their travel information, making it a flexible and user-friendly approach to trip organization and management\
\
**System Components**\
\
The system can be divided into the following components:\
\
**Email Processor**: Responsible for polling and processing travel-related emails\
**Data Integration Layer**: Interfaces with external airline, hotel, and car rental systems\
**Reservation Manager**: Manages user reservations and trip organization\
**User Interface**: Provides a rich user experience on web and mobile platforms\
**Sharing Module**: Enables trip sharing and integration with social media platforms\
\
**Batch Process Analysis**\
\
The system performs batch Process analysis by collecting a wide range of information, including user flight preferences, cab bookings, hotel choices, cancellations, and update frequency data. This data is sourced from both local user databases and external entities such as Global Distribution Systems (GDS), travel agencies, and vendors. The primary objectives of this batch data analysis are to uncover valuable insights and trends, such as: \

1. **Identifying Punctual Airlines**: The analysis enables the identification of airlines that consistently maintain punctuality to specific destinations. This information helps users make informed choices when selecting airlines for their trips.\

2. **User Airline Preferences**: By examining user data, the system can determine the airlines that users prefer when traveling to particular destinations. This knowledge assists in tailoring travel options to individual user preferences.\

3. **Preferred Cab Services**: The batch analysis also uncovers which cab services are favored by users. Understanding these preferences allows for seamless booking experiences and recommendations.\

4. **Hotel Preferences**: The system identifies users' preferred hotel choices, both in destination cities and at specific tourist spots. This information aids in providing personalized recommendations and enhancing the overall travel experience.\
 
In summary, batch data analysis harnesses data from various sources to extract valuable insights that benefit both travelers and service providers. By uncovering trends and preferences, the system can enhance user experiences, streamline bookings, and optimize travel-related services.
