**Technical Use of Notification Flow Diagram**\
This document explains the technical flow and usage of the notification flow diagram for the online trip management system. The diagram represents the flow of notifications within the system, including how notifications are processed, validated, and delivered.\
\
**1. Single Notification vs. Bulk Notification**
\
At the top of the diagram, you see two paths: Single Notification and Bulk Notification. These paths represent the different modes in which notifications can be triggered within the system.\
\
**Single Notification**: This path is followed when a single notification needs to be sent. It is typically used for individual or ad-hoc notifications.\
\
**Bulk Notification**: This path is taken when multiple notifications need to be sent simultaneously. It is often used for sending notifications to a large number of users or for batch processing.\
\
**2. Notification Service**\
The Notification Service is the central component responsible for managing and orchestrating the notification process. It controls the flow of notifications based on the selected path, whether it's a single notification or bulk notification.\
\
**Fail:** If an issue or failure occurs during the notification process, the system handles it accordingly, as indicated in the diagram.\
\
**Pass:** When the notification process proceeds without issues, it moves on to the next stages of processing.\
\
**3. Redis Cache**\
\
Redis Cache is used as a data store and caching mechanism within the notification system. It serves several purposes:\
\
**Storage**: It stores critical data, such as notification content and recipient information.\
\
**Caching**: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data to reduce latency in notification delivery.\
\
**4. Producer**\
\
The Producer component is responsible for generating and queuing notifications. It collects notification data and sends it to the appropriate consumers for further processing.\
\
**5. Consumer**\
\
The Consumer is a component that consumes notifications from the queue and passes them through various stages of processing.\
\
**6. Notification Validator & Prioritizer**\
\
This component validates incoming notifications to ensure they meet the required criteria. It also prioritizes notifications based on predefined rules or criteria. Validated and prioritized notifications proceed to the next stage.\
\
**7. Rate Limiter & Request Count --> Redis Cache**\
\
The Rate Limiter component regulates the rate at which notifications are sent to prevent overwhelming the system or external services. It tracks the number of requests and uses Redis Cache to store this information.\
\
**8. Notification Adapter**\
\
The Notification Adapter is responsible for formatting and delivering notifications to the intended recipients through various channels (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notifications). It adapts the notifications to the specific requirements of each channel.\
\
In summary, this diagram illustrates the flow of notifications within the online trip management system. It distinguishes between single and bulk notifications, outlines the components responsible for processing notifications, and highlights key functions such as validation, prioritization, rate limiting, and adaptation for delivery. This flow ensures efficient and reliable notification management within the system.
