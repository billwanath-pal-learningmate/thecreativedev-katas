**Introduction**\
\
In the context of the online trip management system, a queue mechanism is used to efficiently manage and process various types of tasks related to trip reservations. These tasks include handling incoming emails, receiving updates from travel service providers, and managing manual reservations. This document outlines the design and functionality of the queue mechanism within the online trip management system.\
\
**Components**\
\
Trip Reservation: Represents the core entity within the system, comprising all relevant information about a traveler's trip, including emails, updates, and manually added reservations.\
\
**Queues**:\
\
**Emails Queue**: Stores incoming emails that contain travel-related information.\
**Updates Queue**: Stores real-time updates received from airline, hotel, and car rental providers.\
**Manual Queue**: Contains manually added reservations and modifications made by users.\

**Producer:**\
\
**Emails Producer**: Responsible for extracting travel-related emails and enqueuing them into the Emails Queue.\
**Updates Producer**: Interfaces with travel service providers to fetch real-time updates and enqueues them into the Updates Queue.\
**Manual Producer**: Allows users to add, update, or delete reservations manually and enqueues these changes into the Manual Queue.\
\
**Consumer:**\
\
**Emails Consumer**: Monitors the Emails Queue, dequeues emails, and initiates processing tasks for parsing and extracting travel information.\
**Updates Consumer**: Monitors the Updates Queue, dequeues updates, and processes them to update trip details.\
**Manual Consumer**: Monitors the Manual Queue, dequeues user-initiated reservation changes, and applies them to the trip.\
**Task Processing & Logic**: This component contains the logic required for processing tasks. It may include parsing emails, handling API requests to travel service providers, applying manual reservation changes, and updating the trip reservation accordingly.\
\
**Workflow**\
Here's how the queue mechanism works within the online trip management system:\
\
**Producer**:
\
The Emails Producer continuously scans the user's email account for travel-related emails, extracts relevant information, and enqueues them into the Emails Queue.\
The Updates Producer interfaces with airline, hotel, and car rental providers' APIs, retrieves real-time updates, and enqueues them into the Updates Queue.\
The Manual Producer allows users to manually add, update, or delete reservations, and enqueues these changes into the Manual Queue.\
\
**Consumer**:
\
The Emails Consumer continuously monitors the Emails Queue, dequeues emails, and initiates processing tasks to parse and extract travel information.\
The Updates Consumer monitors the Updates Queue, dequeues updates, and processes them to update the trip reservation details.\
The Manual Consumer monitors the Manual Queue, dequeues user-initiated reservation changes, and applies them to the trip reservation.\
\
**Task Processing & Logic**:
\
This component receives tasks from the Consumers and executes the necessary logic. It updates the trip reservation with new information, handles conflicts, and ensures that the dashboard always reflects the latest travel details.\
\
**Benefits**\
\
**Efficiency**: The queue mechanism ensures that tasks are processed asynchronously and efficiently, preventing the system from becoming unresponsive during email processing or API calls.
\
**Real-time Updates**: Real-time updates from travel service providers are processed promptly and applied to the trip reservation.
\
**User Control**: Users have the flexibility to add, modify, or delete reservations manually, which are seamlessly integrated into the trip management system.
\
**Use Cases**
The queue mechanism is essential for managing the flow of data and tasks within the online trip management system. It enables the system to handle incoming emails, real-time updates, and user-initiated changes, ensuring that travelers have access to up-to-date and organized trip information.\
\
The queue mechanism is a vital component of the online trip management system, facilitating the efficient handling of various tasks related to trip reservations. By separating the production and consumption of tasks, the system can provide real-time updates and a seamless user experience while ensuring that all travel-related information is accurately reflected in the dashboard.\
